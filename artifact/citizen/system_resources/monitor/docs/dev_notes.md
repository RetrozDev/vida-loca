# TODO:
- [ ] xxx

> next up
- [ ] Add a tracking for % of redm/fivem/libertym servers to txTracker
- [ ] maybe add some debug logging to `AdminVault.checkAdminsFile()`, to find out why so many people are having issues with their logins
    - maybe even add to the login failed page something like "admin file was reset or modified XXX time ago"
- [ ] Use q5/q95 from QuantileArrayOutput to help me define the buckets, then implement the join check time histogram
- [ ] xxxxxx

- [ ] `cfg cyclical 'exec' command detected to file` should be blocking instead of warning. Behare that this is not trivial without also turning missing exec target read error also being error
- [ ] maybe some sort of lockfile to admins.json file which would disable admin manager?

## New pages:
Overview:
- ???

Players:
- list of players in a table
- name + identifiers input
- auto search with debouncer

History:
- list of warns/bans in a table
- search by id OR identifier (single) with select box
- filter by action type
- filter by admin, and hotlink it from the admins page

Whitelist:
- maybe remove the wl pending join table
- maybe make a "latest whitelists" showing both pending and members (query players + pending and join tables)
- don't forget to keep the "add approval" button

CFG Editor:
- multiple cfg editors
- add backup file to txdata, with the last 100 changes, name of the admin and timestamp



## The Big Things before ts+react rewrite:
- [x] in-core playerlist state tracking
- [x] new proxy console util
- [x] global socket.io connection for playerlist + async responses
- [ ] new config (prepared for multiserver)
- [ ] multiserver tx instance (backend only)


## New config
- july 2023: consider that some vars will be used in more than one component, so making them live in one or another might not be good
- the modules should be the ones to decide when they need to refreshConfig, so inside the module constructor maybe subscribe to change of specific variables, (in or outside of module). Maybe use event dispatchers?!

- early 2023: acho que os defaults deveriam existir dentro dos components
e sempre que outro componente precisar saber uma config, deve passar pelo componente
- need to have a version and have migration, like the database

- do research, but i think we don't need any lib
- break up cfg files into `txData/<profile>/global.txcfg` and `txData/<profile>/server.txcfg`
- cfg file format is
    - trim every line
    - ignore empty lines or lines starting with // or # (may help people testing stuff, depends on file ext?)
    - `param_name=<json object>` (usually strings, but we could encode more complex data types if needed)
    - ignore with warning lines with invalid json objects
- parameters format suggestion: `playercontroller_onJoinCheckWhitelist` (?)
- REQUIRING stuff to ve on the config from the setup process is kinda bad (setupProfile.js), but might be good to check if the file is in there
- at boot, for every default config:
    - check if the cfg file overwrites it
    - check if an environment env overwrites it (case insensitive) then print warning (maybe not all vars, due to unauthorized GSPs)
- warn of any settings in the file that is not being used
- cfg vault has the defaults in the Zod format (for type safety) or simply
```js
const defaults = {
    playercontroller_onjoincheckwhitelist: {
        default: false,
        "accepted types or values??": "??"
    };
}
```
- maybe get rid of txAdmin.ts passing down specific cfgs, and pass txAdmin instance instead
- the modules can go `this.config.onJoinCheckWhitelist = txAdmin.cfgVault.configs.playercontroller_onJoinCheckWhitelist`
- careful because some will passs by value, some may pass as object reference therefore be live updated inside the module
- modules can do `txAdmin.cfgVault.subscribe(this.refreshConfig.bind(this), [...deps])`
- settings_get page reads from `txAdmin.cfgVault.configs`, so if a value was overwritten by proc.env, it will not cause confusion
- settings_save does `txAdmin.cfgVault.save([...])`
- use zod for validation https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod
- maybe even use zod's `.default()`?
- maybe components don't even need to hold a `this.config`? couldn't we just access it directly from the vault?
- need to keep in mind that many configs are used in the webroutes, so maybe just `txAdmin.config.xxx` and `ServerInstance.config.xxx`?
- 'convict' was the name of that one lib



### old settings refactor note:
- save only what changed
- make big settings a class (like TFR)
- settings.getConfig(); - returns the full config tree with unset props as null
- settings.get('object.dot.notation');
- settings.set('object.dot.notation');
- npm search for "object dot"

https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/commit/84f724ed04d07e0b3a765601ad19ce54412f135b


Up next-ish:
- [ ] Tooling:
    - [ ] Inline `.deploy.config.js > copy[]` into `main-builder.js`
    - [ ] Use `dotenv` or something to read FXServer's path from
    - [ ] Adapt `main-builder.js` to accept txAdmin convars
    - [ ] Update `development.md`
- [ ] checar se outros resources conseguem chamar 'txaLogger:menuEvent'?
- [ ] add ram usage to perf chart?
- [ ] Migrate all log routes
- [ ] Add download modal to log pages
- [ ] replace all fxRunner.srvCmd* and only expose:
    - sync fxRunner.srvRawCmd(string) - to be used by live console
    - async fxRunner.srvCmd(array, timeout) - to be awaited with the status response
- [ ] Quebrar snackbar de not admin em dois, um se confirmado que o problema s√£o os identifiers, outro pra qualquer outro tipo de problema
- [ ] after menu client messages rework, add lua54
- [ ] add an fxserver changelog page
- [ ] check EOL and warn user - new Date('2021-09-14T07:38:51+00:00').getTime()
- [ ] maybe remove the sv_maxclients enforcement in the cfg file
- [ ] fix the interface enforcement without port being set as zap server?


### Randoms:
-- Why both have the same debug data? https://i.imgur.com/WGawiyr.png

FIXME: sendMenuMessage('setServerCtx', ServerCtx)

FIXME: quando o menu abrir, deveria voltar os list item pro default deles

-- Adapt `txAdmin:beta:deathLog` as well as add cusstom commands and logs

- pagina de adicionar admin precisa depois do modal, mostrar mais info:
    - username, senha, potencialmente link, instru√ß√µes de login
- FreezeEntityPosition need to get the veh
    - j√° foi feito? tem issue aberto, e j√° teve um pr feito
- come√ßar a ler o ui_label dos manifests e usar na p√°gina de resources
    - ser√° que o bubble j√° adicionou isso no fxserver? n√£o faz parte das docs ainda (oct/2022)


### Server Insights page ideas:
- resource load times
- resource streamed assets
- biggest events, or resources kbps out? something to help see which resource is bottlenecking the network
    - apparently this can be done in scheduler quite easily by modifying the definition of `TriggerClientEvent`
- http requests (grouped by resource, grouped by root domain or both?)
- performance chart with ram usage
- player count (loger window, maybe with some other data)
- top players? 
- map heatmap?!
- player disconnect reasons
- something with server log events like chat messages, kills, leave reasons, etc?

### txAdminAPI interface in base.js:
- Create prop `pendingMessage` to replace `const notify = $.notify({ message: 'xxxxxx' }, {});`
- Pass `notify` as last argument to `success()` and `error()`
- Create default `success()` and `error()`
    - for `success()`: first exec `checkDoLogoutRefresh()`
    - if `pendingMessage` was set: 
        - if data.markdown === true > usar markdown
    - else: send new notify

someday remove the slash() and the ascii restrictions



### Multiserver refactor:
Global:
- WebServer
- AdminVault
- ConfigVault
- DiscordBot
- Logger
- Translator
- DynamicAds
- UpdateChecker > CfxUpdateChecker

Instance[]:
- FXRunner
- Monitor > HealthMonitor
- Scheduler
- PlayerController > PlaylistManager
- ResourcesManager
- StatisticsManager

Questions:
- How to make the database interface (currently in playerController)
- Should break logger and config in 2 or work top->down?

march/2023 insight:
- if no `txData/config`
- move the profile config and data to txdata
- rename `txData/<profile>` to `txData/<profile>_bkp`
- at run time:
    - check if `txData/lock` exists
    - if it doesn't
        - save pid + interface + port to lock file
    - if it does
        - see if the pid is running
        - say "you cant run two tx on the same txdata, open <url> to visit the other one"

### Update Event + Rollout strategy
This is not compatible with the update events.
If patch, show update notification immediately (specially important to quick-fix a bug).
If minor, randomize a delay between 0~24h.
If patch, randomize a delay 0~72h.

Update event idea (not yet greenlit):
- A box similar to the fxserver update one;
- The major/minor updates will have a discord stage event, patches won't;
- Will get the next event date + type (major/minor) through some api (maybe a regex-able string in the GH releases page);
- The pre-event notifications will have a live "in xx time" type countdown
- 2 days before it will show a yellow warning;
- 1 hour before it will become a glowing green box;
- 1 hour after the event start it will become a red update box with generic message, or blue if it's just a patch;
- Note: regarding the changelog part, bubble asked me to ignore for now (may/13) but will talk again somewhen;

### Log page time slider
> We could totally do like a "jump in time" feature for the log page.
> A slider with 500 steps, and an array with 500 timestamps
> this array can be done by dividing the serverLog.length to get the step, then a for loop to get the timestamps


### New database alternatives:
> check the chat saved messages on that chat
- Via lowdb + journal:
    - Keep players saved the way it is (lowdb, one server only)
    - create `txData/actions.json` which is an append-only, line delimited json
    - multiple servers write to this file, use debounced chokidar to read it starting from last offset to reload in-memory state;
- Via sqlite:
    - first txadmin to run will instantiate a `txData/actions.sqlite` database (becoming master)
    - will provide an http endpoint for the slaves to query data
    - leader election can be done via the first to acquire a lock on a file
- Via external server process
    - If server is not running, a standalone server like cockroachdb or rqlite
    - 

Ideas:
- Maybe we could use b-trees to index identifiers/hwids somewhere?
- Maybe we break the separation between players and identifiers, and bans/warns always try to find the respective player
- Maybe we could go full `mongod.exe`
    - very mature, great docs
    - 45mb file, 120mb process
    - to search for ids we can do `{identifiers: {$in: ['discord:xxxxx', 'fivem:yyyyy']}}`

### txAdmin API/integrations:
- ban/warn/whitelist + revoke action: probably exports with GetInvokingResource() for perms 
- get player info (history, playtime, joindate, etc): state bags
- events: keep the way it is
> Note: confirm with bubble
> Don't forget to add a integrations doc page + to the readme
> for menu and internal stuff to use token-based rest api: ok, just make sure to use the webpipe proxy
> for resource permissions, use resource.* ace thing, which also works for exports

> for ban things, bubble wants a generic thing that is not just for txadmin, so any resource could implement it
> so its not exports.txadmin.xxxx, but some other generic thing that bubble would need to expose

> querying user info: in-server monitor resource should set specific state keys (non-replicated), which get properly specified so other resources can also populate any 'generic' fields. thinking of kubernetes-style namespaces as java-style namespaces are disgusting (playerdata.cfx.re/firstjoin or so)
> bans: some sort of generic event/provide-stuff api. generic event spec format is needed for a lot of things, i don't want 'xd another api no other resource uses', i just want all resources from X on to do things proper event-y way
> --bubble
https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/networking/state-bags/

ps.: need to also include the external events reporting thing


### Admin ACE sync:
On server start, or admins permission change:
- write a `txData/<profile>/txAcePerms.cfg` with:
    - remove_ace/remove_principal to wipe old permissions (would need something like `remove_ace identifier.xxx:xx txadmin.* any`)
    - add_ace/add_principal for each admin
- stdin> `exec xxx.cfg; txaBroadcast xxxxx`

- We should be able to get rid of our menu state management, mainly the part that sends to lua what are the admin ids when something changes
To check of admin perm, just do `IsPlayerAceAllowed(src, 'txadmin.xxxxxx')`
> Don't use, but I'll leave it saved here: https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/commit/fd3fae946163e8af472b7f739aed6f29eae8105f
- need to find a way to protect against scripts, cfg/console changing these aces
- would be cool to have a `SetProtectedMonitorAces(table)` native dedicated to txadmin to set every admin/resource ace perms


### txPointing (old txBanana)
- code prototype with ItsANoBrainer#1337 (https://github.com/tabarra/txBanana)
- keybind to toggle gun (grab or put away)
- when you point at player, show above head some info
- when you "shoot" it will open the player menu and hopefully fire a laser or something
- when you right click, slap player (ApplyDamageToPed 5 damage + small psysichs push up and x+y random)


### recipe engine todo:
- remove_path accept array?
- every X download_github wait some time - maybe check if ref or not, to be smarter
- https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git
- easy recipe tester
- fully automated deploy process via CLI. You just set the recipe file path, as well as the required variables, and you can get your server running without any user interaction.


### Report System (random ideas)
- persistent, save in database?
- have two different status: visited (arr of admins), closed (admin that closed)
- this one is worth having discordwebhook

## FXServer Stuff + TODOs

### Rate limiter
We could be more sensible when restarting the server and pushing an event to alert other resources that might want to auto block it.
```bat
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="txAdmin_block_XXXX" dir=in interface=any action=block remoteip=198.51.100.108/32
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="txAdmin_block_XXXX"
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="txAdmin_block_XXXX"
```
https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/search?q=KeyedRateLimiter


### Oversized resources streams
We could wait for the server to finish loading, as well as print in the interface somewhere an descending ordered list of large resource assets
https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/blob/649dac8e9c9702cc3e293f8b6a48105a9378b3f5/code/components/citizen-server-impl/src/ResourceStreamComponent.cpp#L435


### Spectating with routing bucket:
Message from bubble:
> the obvious 'approach' works well enough:
> - get target routing bucket on server
> - save old source
> - teleport source player to in scope
> - send event to source client
> ------- client -------
> - set focus pos and vel, less shit than 'xd teleport' and should trip server to cull anyway
> - make self invisible/such
> - wait for target player to exist
> - use spectate native
> and when stopping spectating do the opposite of that
