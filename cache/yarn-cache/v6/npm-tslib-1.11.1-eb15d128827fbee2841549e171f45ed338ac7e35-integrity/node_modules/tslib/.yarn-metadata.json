    "readme": "# tslib\n\nThis is a runtime library for [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) that contains all of the TypeScript helper functions.\n\nThis library is primarily used by the `--importHelpers` flag in TypeScript.\nWhen using `--importHelpers`, a module that uses helper functions like `__extends` and `__assign` in the following emitted file:\n\n```ts\nvar __assign = (this && this.__assign) || Object.assign || function(t) {\n    for (var s, i = 1, n = arguments.length; i < n; i++) {\n        s = arguments[i];\n        for (var p in s) if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(s, p))\n            t[p] = s[p];\n    }\n    return t;\n};\nexports.x = {};\nexports.y = __assign({}, exports.x);\n\n```\n\nwill instead be emitted as something like the following:\n\n```ts\nvar tslib_1 = require(\"tslib\");\nexports.x = {};\nexports.y = tslib_1.__assign({}, exports.x);\n```\n\nBecause this can avoid duplicate declarations of things like `__extends`, `__assign`, etc., this means delivering users smaller files on average, as well as less runtime overhead.\nFor optimized bundles with TypeScript, you should absolutely consider using `tslib` and `--importHelpers`.\n\n# Installing\n\nFor the latest stable version, run:\n\n## npm\n\n```sh\n# TypeScript 2.3.3 or later\nnpm install --save tslib\n\n# TypeScript 2.3.2 or earlier\nnpm install --save tslib@1.6.1\n```\n\n## yarn\n\n```sh\n# TypeScript 2.3.3 or later\nyarn add tslib\n\n# TypeScript 2.3.2 or earlier\nyarn add tslib@1.6.1\n```\n\n## bower\n\n```sh\n# TypeScript 2.3.3 or later\nbower install tslib\n\n# TypeScript 2.3.2 or earlier\nbower install tslib@1.6.1\n```\n\n## JSPM\n\n```sh\n# TypeScript 2.3.3 or later\njspm install tslib\n\n# TypeScript 2.3.2 or earlier\njspm install tslib@1.6.1\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nSet the `importHelpers` compiler option on the command line:\n\n```\ntsc --importHelpers file.ts\n```\n\nor in your tsconfig.json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"importHelpers\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### For bower and JSPM users\n\nYou will need to add a `paths` mapping for `tslib`, e.g. For Bower users:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"amd\",\n        \"importHelpers\": true,\n        \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n        \"paths\": {\n            \"tslib\" : [\"bower_components/tslib/tslib.d.ts\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor JSPM users:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"system\",\n        \"importHelpers\": true,\n        \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n        \"paths\": {\n            \"tslib\" : [\"jspm_packages/npm/tslib@1.11.1/tslib.d.ts\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n# Contribute\n\nThere are many ways to [contribute](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to TypeScript.\n\n* [Submit bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues) and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n* Review the [source code changes](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pulls).\n* Engage with other TypeScript users and developers on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript).\n* Join the [#typescript](http://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23typescript) discussion on Twitter.\n* [Contribute bug fixes](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n* Read the language specification ([docx](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267121), [pdf](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267238)).\n\n# Documentation\n\n* [Quick tutorial](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Tutorial)\n* [Programming handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook)\n* [Language specification](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md)\n* [Homepage](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n",
